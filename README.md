#### Indian Cricket team
 My father is big fan of cricket.I used to watch along with him so that made me to get interest on this game.This is my favorite sport since it offers plenty of thrills and excitement for both players and spectators.**The sport cricket encourages each player to understand their team players**.By playing games we get physically fit and it also helps in **learning how to deal with wins and losses**.
